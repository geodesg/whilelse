# Contributing

I have open-sourced this project in the hope that you can help make it a
success faster.

One way to help is to give feedback.
Try creating something simple but useful in Whilelse and let me know
which are the most annoying deficiencies and bugs.

See: [Getting Started](getting-started.md)

You can contribute:

* feedback, [bug
  reports](https://github.com/whilelse/whilelse/issues)
* ideas
* code, libraries
* [documentation](https://github.com/whilelse/whilelse/wiki)
* [money](https://www.patreon.com/leventebagi?ty=h)

I work on it full time, and the product of my work so far is now open
source. I plan to provide commercial services and support around the
core product.

Get in touch if you would be interested in pre-ordering commercial
services.

Become an early contributor and you will get discounted or free access to
commercial products & services,
plus you'll gain experience that will give you an advantage in
providing your own Whilelse-related products and services.

You can be one of the first contributors! -
A chance to shape the programming tool of the future.
